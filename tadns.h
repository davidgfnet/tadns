/*
 * Simple asynchronous DNS resolver.
 * Can resolve A records (IP addresses for a given name),
 * and MX records (IP addresses of mail exchanges for a given domain).
 * It holds resolved IP addresses in a cache.
 *
 * Can be used as a library, and be compiled into C/C++ program.
 * Can be compiled as stand-alone program similar to `dig' utility.
 *
 * Compilation:
 *    cc -DADIG dns.c        (UNIX)
 *    cl dns.c /DADIG        (Windows, MSVS)
